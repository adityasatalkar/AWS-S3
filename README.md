# AWS-S3
This is a a repo that contains all the shell scripts for listing out all S3 object's key names who have public access

This repo is made for those who are new to the world of Amazon's Web Services. I've made this repo so that you can look into how to access AWS S3 objects and see what Access permissions they have.

When I started I had no idea of how to go about any of this. I had to hone my skills in Shell and then I came across another challenge, of parsing JSON via terminal. Which is one reason I've used jq library to help parse the JSON reply from AWS.
